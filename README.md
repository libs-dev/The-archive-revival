⚜️ The Archive Revival | High-End Resale Boutique

Project Overview

The Archive Revival is a responsive, single-page website prototype for a fictional high-end fashion reselling store. The design philosophy centers on Opulent Minimalism, utilizing a sophisticated color palette of charcoal grey, soft white, and elegant typography (Inter and Didot) to convey luxury, exclusivity, and trustworthiness.

This project is built as a single static HTML file, making it extremely fast and easy to inspect and deploy.

Design Philosophy: Opulent Minimalism

The core aesthetic is defined by:

Color Palette: High-contrast pairing of deep charcoal (#292929 / bg-stone-800) and soft off-white (bg-stone-50).

Typography: Mixing the modern, clean Inter font for body text with a classic serif stack (like Didot or Georgia) for major titles, giving an editorial, luxury magazine feel.

Layout: Clean grids, ample whitespace, and focused content blocks ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.

Key Features

Fully Responsive Layout: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using Tailwind's utility classes.

Smooth Navigation: Features a sticky header and smooth-scrolling internal links to key sections (#featured, #consign, #about) with a mobile-friendly overlay menu.

Product Grid: A responsive grid showcasing mock luxury items, adapting from 2 columns on mobile to 3 columns on desktop.

Consignment Process: A clear, three-step guide detailing how users can sell their items with the platform.

Newsletter Signup: Simple form structure for email capture (front-end only).

Technologies Used

HTML5: The core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS (CDN): Utility-first framework used for rapid, responsive styling.

JavaScript: Minimal client-side code for toggling the mobile navigation menu and managing smooth-scroll offsets for the fixed header.
